# GLKit

A GLKit sample for bypassing iPhone 7/8 Plus downsampling.

Autostereoscopic 3d display requires precise gray-level for each pixel. The iPhone 7+ and iPhone 8+ default upsampling-downsampling behavior would make the image quality extremly blur. Use this GLKit so that I can readily set each piexl value without any loss.
